>*known bugs. reflections still do not match, but are no longer painful to look at so they will not negitively impact your gameplay*


<H2> This mod is designed to avoid as much dependencies as possible so when updating beatsaber if BSML is not updated yet you can still adjust the settings in a config file located at</h2> <br>
 \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\UserData\PiFix.JSON 
 <h2> 
 there will be something similar to this<br> </h2>
 {<br>
  "PimaxType": "None",<br>
  "DisableLighting": false<br>
}<br>
<br>
<h3>change "None" to say your HMD model either FiveK, EightK or TwelveK 
 <br>an example would look like </h3>

# Q&A

<h2>My beatsaber lighting is still messed up, your mod is broken. why dont you fix it?</h2>

> If the mod is not working after you have installed it. please make sure that the proper game version is being used for this version of the mod. as well as be sure that BSIPA is installed to the version required for that version of beatsaber. As this mod requires BSIPA in order to work. If you have the properly installed game version, as well as the proper BSIPA version and the correct mod version. check in PiTool. if you have Parallel Projections enabled. Please turn it off. Parallel projections not only cuts your frame rate. But also causes your Pimax device to behave just like any other headset and you would be getting the double vision problem with your headset please make sure that you enabled the mod inside of the BSML mod settings. there are 6 options. "none" "FiveK" "EightK" "TwelveK" "Crystal" and "ValveIndex" . if "none" is selected. that means it will be rendering the game like it would be for every other headset. If you have selected "FiveK" please check in Pitool to show what headset you have. If your headset is a 5k+, 5kXR, 5ks, or Artisan. please use the setting called "FiveK" this is because the 5k headsets render differently than the 8k headsets. If in Pitool it shows an 8K, 8K+ or an 8KX please use the setting called "EightK" this is because the 8k headsets render differently from the 5k headsets. If in Pitool it shows a 12k please use the setting called "TwelveK" this is because the 12k headsets render differently from the 5k headsets and 8k headsets. Please have the setting enabled that is properly designed for your headset
